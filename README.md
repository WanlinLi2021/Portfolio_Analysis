# Portfolio Analysis

We create a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyses and visualises the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, 
and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. 

## Datasets
The historical daily returns of several portfolios: 
- some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios 
- some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett
- some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 


We use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that 
of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P TSX 60 Index).
